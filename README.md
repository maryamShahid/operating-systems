# Operating Systems

This repository is a container for the projects I developed during CS342 - Operating System Concepts

* [Intercepting Shell Program](https://github.com/maryamShahid/intercepting-shell-program): An intercepting shell program which executes user commands. For piped instructions, POSIX pipes are used.
* [Multithreaded Scheduling](https://github.com/maryamShahid/multi-threaded-scheduling): This project focuses on multithreaded scheduling of processes using FCFS, SJF, PRIO and VRUNTIME algorithms. This project allowed me to practice deadlock preventation, synchronization and the theory of CPU scheduling.
* [Main Memory Management](https://github.com/maryamShahid/main-memory-management): This project is a main memory management library that allows processes to dynamically allocate/deallocate memory using the buddy system algorithm.
* [Simple File System](https://github.com/maryamShahid/simple-file-system): This project is a secondary memory management library that allows processes to store data in a virtual disk containing a virtual file system using indexed allocation and bitmap.
